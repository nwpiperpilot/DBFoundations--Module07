<h2>Assignment 07 – Functions<br>
<br>
<h3>Introduction<br>
<h4>In this assignment I will discuss SQL Functions.

<h3>When to Use a SQL UDF<br>
<h4>A SQL User Defined Function (UDF) provides the ability to call on a specific piece of logic in code as a function rather than having to write out the long form code every time it’s needed.

<h3>Differences Between Scalar, Inline & Multi-Statement Functions<br>
<h4>A scalar UDF takes one or more parameters and returns a single value.  An inline table-valued function returns a variable of data type table whose value comes from a single SELECT statement.  And finally, a Multi-Statement Function returns a table as its’ output.

<h3>Conclusion<br>
<h4>This week’s assignment was to learn about SQL Functions and to apply what we learned using SQL code.
